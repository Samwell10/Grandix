                    In most retail establishments, shoplifting is common. Each year, retail shrinkage costs retailers 
                    billions of pounds, with personnel accounting for 38% of the losses. Both verbal and physical 
                    intimidation is experienced by retail staff. In the very competitive retail sector, research 
                    demonstrates that the presence of security agents helps to prevent assault and adds to 
                    minimising shrinkage. Reduced shrinkage might result in growth and higher profit margins.

                    Just 3% of activated alarms receive a police response. What happens if they don't answer yours?
                    Our alarm response team can respond instantly and independently, either with your key holder or 
                    without. We coordinate with the police and give you a thorough incident report. Our proactive 
                    mobile patrol crews will continuously patrol your locations day and night, at predetermined 
                    intervals, or at random. We offer a free Deter Control system. This electronic clocking system 
                    creates a report that includes the patrol's position, date, and time. In order to ensure a prompt 
                    response, if this is used, we make sure that our patrol teams are within a 10-mile radius of your 
                    property.
